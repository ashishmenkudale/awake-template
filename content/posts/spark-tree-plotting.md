With big data comes a big challenge of visualizing it efficiently. And moreover, if we are developing a machine learning model with pyspark, there are only handful of visualization packages available. Recently, I was developing a decision tree model in pyspark and to infer the model, I was looking for a visualization module.

I came across this awesome ![spark-tree-plotting](https://github.com/julioasotodv/spark-tree-plotting) package. This post is about implementing this package in pyspark.

Few installs,
