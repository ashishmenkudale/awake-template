            <h4>Founder and Captain <small> -  Team Pravega, Formula SAE collegiate chapter, May 2012 - Aug 2014 </small> </h4>
              <p>
                <span>&#8226;</span> <a href="https://drive.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=http%3A//www.jsae.or.jp/formula/jp/12th/pdf/no_70.pdf&embedded=true"> Official team report </a>
                <span>&#8226;</span> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjfrJWS7JkQ&feature=youtu.be"> Official team movie </a>
              </p>

              <p>
              I started the initiative named 'Team Pravega' during the second year of my undergraduation. 
              I led the team of 25 members which designed, fabricated and assembled a student prototype of formula one car.
              </p>
              <p>
              The objective was to utilize the engineering practices which were taught during engineering curriculum and apply 
              those to build a prototype of a formula one car which would compete in an endurance race organized for engineering 
              students at international level.
              </p>
              <p>
              I managed to lead the team successfully to compete in Japan FSAE competition in September 2014.
              </p>

              </figure>
              <br />

              <p>
               Being the initiator, it was a great deal of comprehensive experience to manage the design team, 
               marketing and sponsorship team, fabrication schedule and finance team. 
              </p>
              <p>
              During the process, I worked on design software (Solidworks 3D), analysis software (Solidworks, Ansys), 
              presentation and report making software (MS office suit) and various fabrication tools with hands-on experience.
              </p>
            
          <h4>Core team member <small> -  Team Abadha, SAE India collegiate chapter, Feb 2011 - May 2014 </small> </h4> 
            <p>
            Team Abadha CRCE is a competitor in SAE BAJA competition in India. The competition involves designing, 
            fabricating and assembling an all-terrain vehicle and participating in an endurance race at Natrip Track, Indore, India.
            Since the first year of my undergraduation course, I got associated with SAE collegiate club which was 
            then newly established in the college.
            </p>
            <p>
            I learned vehicle dynamics and extensively studied related literature. I worked on the chassis design, 
            suspension and steering design and powertrain analysis over the duration of three years. I represented my college 
            at the national level, virtual screening rounds (Technical design presentation round) for two times consecutively 
            and got selected for BAJA main event.

              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
            I utilized this opportunity to demonstrate my teamwork skills, leadership quality, technical presentations skills, 
            time-management and fabrication skills.
